# My Bootcamp Notes

## Description

My motivation for creating this website is to provide a platform for my notes on what I learn in this coding bootcamp. I built this website to help organize my notes in a format that is easy to follow and pleasant to look at. This solved the problem of me not having a place for my bootcamp notes. I learned all about the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript!

This website provides a place to read notes on the topics HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. The site also allows me to view how each of those elements work. For example, HTML and CSS are implimented in the style and formatting of the website. If I open up the console in DevTools, I can also see how JavaScript was incorporated.
